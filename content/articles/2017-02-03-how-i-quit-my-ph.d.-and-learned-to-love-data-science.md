The attempts to define data science over the last 7 years innumerable and, at times, humorous.

As I explained [in an earlier post](http://stiglerdiet.com/blog/2015/May/11/how-i-became-a-data-scientist/) @@@

And the hype has been unparalleled:

## Math, Modeling, and Communication

I have quipped before that one of the most frustrating things in grad school was professors giving ambiguous problems in homework and on tests, but, in hindsight, that was some of the best job training I got.

My friend [John Cook has written](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2016/12/11/most-mathematical-problem-statement/):

> Every so often college students will ask me for advice regarding going into applied math. Iâ€™ll tell them the first step in an application, and often the hardest step, is formulating a problem, not solving it. People donâ€™t approach you with mathematical problems _per se_ but problems that can be turned into mathematical problems. Nobody is going to hand you a precisely formulated math problem. That only happens on exams.

How true this is, even in data science. @@@@ WHY DS COME PREDEFINED @@@@

C.F. Kettering (head of research at General Motors from 1920 to 1947) proportedly would say, "A problem well stated is a problem half-resolved."

If stating a problem well is half the resolution, effectively communicating the results is the other 40% (leaving 10% for actually solving the problem). Communicating results rarely means handing over a table full of data. As [the lengendary Richard Hamming](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Methods-Scientists-Engineers-Mathematics/dp/0486652416/) said, "The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers." In data science, people [love to talk about "story telling"](http://www.forbes.com/sites/brentdykes/2016/03/31/data-storytelling-the-essential-data-science-skill-everyone-needs/#10766460f0c8) as the ultimate form of data insight. I'm skeptical that "storytelling" is always the right analogy, @@@

Do you want to be an effective data scientist? Learn how to work from ambiguous instructions to a clear problem and well defined problem. Learn how to communicate well, especially in writing.

Of course, formulating a problem mathematically, solving the problem, and interpreting the results requires an understanding of the math. (I use "math" in a broad sense here: math, statistics, machine learning, etc.) In some situations, the technical details of the mathematics might be ultimately be the most import aspect solving the problem.

This post is inspired by [a talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_wdSh2PFxiqBegt5PcatbEiQaganlgdb5bH7V2jHXZI/edit?usp=sharing) I recently gave to the [Duke Big Data Initiative](http://bigdata.duke.edu/) entitled _<s>Dr.</s> Hopper, or How I Quit My Ph.D. and Learned to Love Data Science_. The talk was well received, and [my slides](https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/827239362404433922/photo/1) seemed to resonate in the Twitter data science community.
