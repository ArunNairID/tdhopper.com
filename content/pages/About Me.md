Title: About Me
Slug: about-me
Author: Tim

I'm interested in math, data, machine learning, computation, decision making, and optimization.

I am a data scientist at [Distil Networks](http://distilnetworks.com). I previously worked as a data scientist for [Qadium, Inc](https://qadium.com/ "QADIUM"), data engineer at [Parse.ly](http://parse.ly) and a data scientist at [RTI International](http://www.rti.org/ "RTI International"). I have a masters in operations research from North Carolina State University where I worked with [Brian Denton](http://sitemaker.umich.edu/btdenton/home) on approximate dynamic programming in healthcare. I also spent a year as a grad student in math at the [University of Virginia](http://www.math.virginia.edu "Department of Mathematics, U.Va."). My undergraduate degree from [Grove City College](http://www.gcc.edu/Pages/Grove-City-College.aspx "Grove City College") is in mathematics; I also earned minors in applied physics and computer science.

In my free time, I enjoy conversation, reading, hiking, (more) programming, and beer.

### Projects

* I built a [high-performance Python package](https://github.com/datamicroscopes/lda) for Gibbs sampling-based inference for nonparametric topic modeling (HDP-LDA).
* I have another blog for quick posts tracking [Things I've Learned](http://til.tdhopper.com/).
* I am a contributor to [streamparse](https://github.com/Parsely/streamparse "Parsely/streamparse Â· GitHub") which integrates Python and Apache Storm for real-time data processing.
* I have a single page website to collect notes on one of my other hobbies: [ultralight backpacking](http://www.ultratall-ultralight.com/). In particular, notes on ultralight gear for the very tall.
* I created a website called [Should I Get a Ph.D.?](http://shouldigetaphd.com "Should I Get A Ph.D.?") to help college students in technical fields considering a a Ph.D. make more informed decisions. There's also a [companion Twitter account](https://twitter.com/shouldyougetphd "Should You Get a PhD (@ShouldYouGetPhD) | Twitter") that has been known to share sarcasm and relevant links.
* I created a [website to share the writings of my late grandfather and great-grandfather](http://joseph-hopper.com "Joseph-Hopper.com") who were both prolific Presbyterian missionaries and theologians.
* I kinda [built my own standing desk](https://plus.google.com/photos/118317721686581801159/albums/5885822848717804001 "None").
* To see a variety of half-baked projects and small open source contributions, you can check out my [Github profile](https://github.com/tdhopper?tab=repositories "tdhopper (Timothy Hopper)").
* I'm trying to [deobfuscate Dirichlet Processes and Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes](https://github.com/tdhopper/notes-on-dirichlet-processes) for nonparametric Bayesian methods.
* I have [a Tumblr dedicated to comments about my height](http://doyouplayball.tumblr.com/). There's a companion [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/doyouplayball).
* I created [a Twitter account](https://twitter.com/current_moon) that tweets a emoji each evening (in the eastern US) representing the current phase of the moon. I also created a Twitter account that [tweets links to articles about philosophy](https://twitter.com/sep_articles).
* I created a [Github project](https://github.com/tdhopper/tau) that provides a template for creating Lambda-powered Twitter bots in Python.


### Talks, Presentations, Publications

* At Pydata Carolinas 2016, I [gave a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRul8QdYvqQ) on how and why data scientists should think about sharing their data-tinkering on the web.
* At Pydata NYC 2015, I [gave a talk](https://github.com/tdhopper/pydata-nyc-2015) on understanding Latent Dirichlet Allocation using Python to simulate the generative model. It was [recorded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R66X_udxZQ)! I gave a [longer version of the talk in 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy-XhT2sHgM&feature=youtu.be).
* I am a coauthor on [Using Twitter Data to Gain Insights into E-cigarette Marketing and Locations of Use: An Infoveillance Study](http://www.jmir.org/2015/11/e251/).
* I gave an [intro to PySpark](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/format/slides/github/tdhopper/rta-pyspark-presentation/blob/master/slides.ipynb#/) at the [Research Triangle Analysts](http://www.rtpanalysts.org/home/ "Research Triangle Analysts") in early 2015.
* I talked about [the design of scikit-learn](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/format/slides/github/tdhopper/Research-Triangle-Analysts--Intro-to-scikit-learn/blob/master/Intro%20to%20Scikit-Learn.ipynb#/) at the [Research Triangle Analysts](http://www.rtpanalysts.org/home/ "Research Triangle Analysts | Analysts in the Research Triangle Region of North Carolina") in early 2014. There is a (poor quality) video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kx19t8bNMU).
* I talked about [Pickle and Redis](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/tdhopper/Pickle-and-Redis/blob/master/Pickle%20and%20Redis.ipynb "") at PyCarolinas in 2012.
* I talked about [Bringing Operations Research into the 21st Century with Online Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gfBH4mC_iU) at [INFORMS 2011](http://meetings2.informs.org/charlotte2011/ "INFORMS Annual Meeting | 13th November 2011").
