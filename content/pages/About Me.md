I'm interested in math, data, computation, decision making, and optimization. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of these. 

I am a currently backend data engineer at [Parse.ly](parse.ly). I have a masters in operations research from North Carolina State University where I worked with [Brian Denton](http://sitemaker.umich.edu/btdenton/home) on approximate dynamic programming in healthcare. After grad school, I was a data scientist at [RTI International](http://www.rti.org/). 

In my free time, I enjoy conversation, reading, hiking, (more) programming, and amber ale.
